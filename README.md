# SketchCAD
Sketching application which dynamically offers interpretations of rough sketches into parametric designs. Principle of additive constraints.

Looking to experiment with minimally disruptive interface using PyQt and opencv. This will be a rough prototype requiring stack change for performance/efficiency and use on eink drawing tablet (remarkable tablet).
